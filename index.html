			<p>3D printing is a process of creating three dimensional objects through layered deposition of material, most often thermoplastic, using a CNC machine designed for the task.  The CNC machines are usually referred to as "3D Printers" due to their functional similarity to more traditional 2D printing machines. Where 2D printers use ink to create a single layer, 3D printers stack layers to create an object. Simple right? Absolutely!</p>

				<p>So you've just received that shiny new printer and you're chomping at the bit to get started?  Begin by carefully removing the printer from its packaging and organizing all the included components.  The most useful item at this point will be the assembly instructions.  These ought to guide your hand in removing any protective films, securing ties or bracing pieces that were added to protect the unit during shipping.</p>
				<p>Take care to dust off any little scraps of styrofoam or cardboard from any moving parts. Canned air for cleaning computers or something functionally similar is useful here, just make sure it's dry!</p>

				<p>The build plate will be one of the most interacted with areas of the machine, as this is where the magic happens! Care and attention to this area will prevent many common challenges and lead to easier "succesful prints".</p>
				<p>The base build plate is typically constructed of aluminum due to its combination of strength, light weight and superior thermal conductivity. Many designs present the build plate as-is, leaving the operator to choose their desired build substrate. Some designs will incorporate an extra substrate layer to enhance adhesion of the object during printing. This can range from proprietary layers like BuildTak, to simple blue painters tape.</p>
				<p><code>My personal favorite build layer thus far has been a plate of high-precision borosilicate glass. I used a very thin layer of self-tacking silicone to adhere the glass layer to the aluminum bed.  During heating I simply mist a light coat of AquaNet hairspray onto the glass for a high strength bond that releases easily once the plate cools after the build. The glass has an incredible lifespan and the hairspray is almost free.  If your printer has a "naked" aluminum bed, I highly recommend this upgrade.</code></p>

				<p>Preheating the printer is simple, but necessary, as the filament requires a specific temperature to flow and adhere optimally.  Each filament type is different and even some brands vary due to slight differences in composition. If the filament manufacturer has a recommended temperature, start there. Otherwise refer to a common <a href="https://3dinsider.com/3d-printing-materials/">type to temp reference</a> as  a starting point.</p>

				<p>Filament is what becomes the model.  Whichever type of material you use should be based on the desired use case or outcome for your project.  If you are printing things for fun, to display or just experimmenting, PLA can be a very easy and affordable option. It also has the benefit of being made from some plant sources. ABS can be very strong and more thermally resistant, but creates toxic fumes during printing.  This will require ventilation and airflopw, which poses its own problems for keeping the model thermally stable during printing to avoid "shrinkage". PETG makes for a great "best of both worlds" in that it produces no toxic gases, is very strong, has high thermal resistance and prints almost as easily as PLA. Though at a slightly higher cost.</p>
				<p>There is typically a lever or button to press to relieve pressure from the filament/extruder gears. Once the extruder is heated the filament may be added or removed by pressing this button and pulling the filament from the extruder.  There will always be a little melted filament left in the extruder, so when adding a new type or color it is a good idea to either have an extra scrap part to print, or manually feed it through until the previous filament is cleared. </p>
				<p><code>You can queue up new filament by holding the lever down and gently feeding it into the pre-heated extruder until you feel a little resistance and some comes out the nozzle</code></p>

				<p>Unless you have a nicely calibrated auto-leveling mechanism, this is something that will need to be done prior to each print, and can be a bit fiddly. Often there are small adjustment screws at the corners of the build plate that can be tightened or loosened to adjust the height of that corner.  When the extruder is in free move mode, you can move it by hand to different corners of the build surface. Slide a scrap of flat paper under the nozzle. It should touch the surface and the nozzle at the same time but still move. Do this repeatedly at each corner until all areas tested have the same resistance feel. It is important do ensure that the paper is smooth and flat (no creases) and that the extruder tip is clean</p>
				<p><code>ProTip: A soft cloth or paper towel soaked with a bit of isopropyl alcohol will wipe any residue right off a heated extruder nozzle. The wipe should stay wet and have plenty of pile under your hand for safety. Do this at your own risk and be very careful not to burn yourself or your wipe!</code></p>

				<p>Many software solutions abound for handling your modeling and printing prep tasks. CNC machines require some form of "Numerical Code" to interpret motion commands.  This is what your slicing software is for.  After creating your model and outputting it as an ".stl"(stereolithography) file type, it must be imported and processed by the slicing software.</p>
				<p><code>Unsponsored plug: Ultimaker has an excellent, free app called Cura that excels in usability and beginner friendliness.</code></p>
				<p>The slicing software will allow for settings to speed, temperature, infill pattern, shell thickness and a variety of other inputs. It will then create a coded path for the extruder to follow and output all of this as a ".gcode" file for the printer to execute.</p>
				<p>At this point you are ready to try your first "Benchy".  Congratulations, and welcome to the wonderful world of 3D printing!</p>
